# ðŸ§ª Android + OpenCV (C++) + OpenGL + TypeScript Web Viewer â€” RnD Intern Assessment

This project skeleton contains the minimal files and structure to help you start the assignment.
**You still need to open the project in Android Studio, provide proper Gradle files, add OpenCV SDK, and configure NDK.**

## Project structure (skeleton)
```
android-opencv-opengl-assignment/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ java/com/example/app/MainActivity.kt
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ java/com/example/app/NativeLib.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ jni/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ native-lib.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ web/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## What this ZIP includes
- Minimal Kotlin files showing how to call JNI.
- Minimal C++ native file (OpenCV calls are stubbed; include OpenCV in your CMake when available).
- A CMakeLists.txt that is a placeholder â€” adjust paths for OpenCV SDK on your machine.
- A tiny TypeScript web viewer skeleton.
- README with instructions and next steps.

## Important next steps (you must do these locally)
1. Open Android Studio and create a proper Android project (or import this folder into a full project).  
2. Add Gradle (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`) and Android manifest â€” not included in this skeleton.  
3. Download OpenCV Android SDK and point `CMakeLists.txt` to the OpenCV SDK path.  
4. Configure `app/build.gradle` to enable externalNativeBuild (CMake) and set the NDK version.  
5. Build and run on an Android device with USB debugging enabled.  
6. Place sample processed images into `/web` to preview the web viewer.
